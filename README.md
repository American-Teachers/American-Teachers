# American Teachers

Almost 2 billion students currently do not have an easy, reliable infrastructure to transition fully online - many of them will be academically left behind. Major platforms like Google Classrooms and Khanacademy are optimally built to supplement in-person learning for existing schools, not serve as an alternative. Americanteachers.com envisions a reality where the experience of going to school online will be almost indistinguishable, if not better, than going in-person. It will revolutionize how we educate people onto the 21st/22nd century and serve as a global model for schools transitioning online.

The app provides existing and upcoming teachers/students the platform necessary to create or continue their education under an online school platform. Teachers can offer courses and invite existing/prospective students to their virtual classroom and host faculty meetings whereas students can join existing or interesting classrooms.

It will also provide additional resources for teachers to enhance the learning experience such as virtual field trips.

The app aims to be the all-in-one platform for teachers to create assignments and host interactive virtual discussions.
